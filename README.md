# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge project was to utilize web-scraping to scrape full-resolution images, titles, and data. Data was then stored on the Mongo database and used a web application to display the data.

## Problems:
I ran into some issues with this module especially running on my server the images would not appear. I will be re-visiting this module to attempt to re-do the assignment and ask for help.
